        const workoutsContent = `The "45 MASTER SESSIONS Program" is designed for individuals who are "getting up in years" or have extensive lifting experience, offering an engaging and challenging way to continue their fitness journey. The author emphasizes the self-regulating nature of the program, making it adaptable to individual needs.

Here's how the program is structured and its progressive overload scheme:

### Program Structure

* **Goals and Philosophy**:
    * The program aims to help **drop body fat**, **increase work capacity**, **build/maintain strength**, and **lengthen longevity** in the sport.
    * It's designed to be **fun** and reignite passion for lifting, rather than primarily focusing on massive strength gains like adding 200lbs to a deadlift.
    * It emphasizes **shorter, more functional, and completely self-regulating sessions**.
    * Workouts are streamlined, cutting away "nonsense and fat" to leave simple, effective sessions that promote health and happiness.
* **Session Length and Frequency**:
    * Each session is designed to last no longer than **30-40 minutes**.
    * It encourages **24-48 hours between barbell sessions** for maximum benefit, but also advises taking "as long as needed between workouts" due to the target population's recovery needs.
    * Athletes can choose to train daily with lighter weights or stretch the 5 sessions over a 10-day split if opting for heavier weights.
* **Program Organization**:
    * The program is composed of **45 sessions**, structured into "Waves".
    * Each "Wave" consists of **3, 5-Day Blocks of training**, with undulated intensities.
* **Daily Workout Blocks**:
    * Most lifting days include a **Strength Block**, a **Volume Block**, and an **Assistance Finisher**.
    * Functional movement focus days feature a **Carry Block**, a **Pull-Up Block**, and a **Core/Loading Block** instead.
    * **Strength Block**: Involves building up to a top set of a main lift (e.g., Deadlifts, Strict Presses, Squats, Bench Presses) within 10-20 minutes, with specific percentage goals relative to a 1RM. Core or conditioning exercises are performed between attempts.
    * **Volume Block**: Utilizes an **"Every Minute on the Minute" (EMOM) style** for 10 minutes. At the start of each new minute, a set of prescribed reps (e.g., 2-3 Deadlifts at 80-85% of your top set from the Strength Block) is completed. The remainder of the minute is for rest or optional added exercises.
    * **Assistance Finisher**: Consists of additional exercises, often with a specific time or round goal (e.g., As Many Rounds As Possible in 10 minutes, 5 Rounds in front of a running clock).
    * **Reps and Form**: Reps are kept relatively low to maintain **100% focus and attention**, reduce opportunities for bad reps, and prevent injuries. The program is designed to **improve form**, not destroy it, and emphasizes that every rep should be a "mindful practice".

### Progressive Overload Scheme

The program implements progressive overload through a combination of **self-regulation, increasing workload, and structured intensity progression across waves**:

* **Self-Regulation and Choice**:
    * The challenge level is **"completely up to you"**.
    * Athletes are encouraged to **manipulate bar weight** throughout the 10 sets of the Volume Block to match their daily energy and focus levels, yielding the best results.
* **Increasing Workload within Minutes (EMOM)**:
    * If a session feels too easy, instead of just increasing weight, you can **add extra core or conditioning exercises** after your main mover is complete during the remaining "rest" time within the 60-second EMOM minute.
    * Examples include adding 15 Hollow Rocks or 3 Burpees after squats. This significantly increases workload and decreases rest periods.
    * You can also **add weight to the bar** or combine exercises like pull-ups or dragon flags to the minute's main mover for a harder session.
* **Ramping for New Exercises**:
    * If you encounter exercises for which you don't have established PRs, you can use a **"ramping" method** for the 10 one-minute sets. This means gradually adding a small amount of weight each set until your form can no longer be effectively held or your bar speed slows down unacceptably. Once an appropriate weight is found, you stick with it for the remaining sets.
* **Structured Intensity Progression Across Waves**:
    * The program undulates intensities across its 3 Waves and 9 Blocks.
    * The **goal for the "Top Set" in the Strength Block** progressively increases in terms of percentage of 1RM (or aims for a new PR) as you move through the waves for key lifts:
        * For example, Day 1 (Wave 1/Block 1) Deadlifts aim for a top set of at least **85% of Your 1RM**.
        * Day 16 (Wave 2/Block 4) Deadlifts aim for **90% of Your 1RM**.
        * Day 31 (Wave 3/Block 7) Deadlifts aim for **95% of Your 1RM or a new PR**.
    * Similarly, the target intensity for **Carry Blocks** also increases across waves. For instance, a Light Farmer's Carry starts at 40-45% of your maximum carry weight in Wave 1/Block 1 and progresses to 60-70% in Wave 3/Block 7. Heavy Single Arm Farmer's Walks increase from 80-85% in Wave 1/Block 3 to 85-90% in Wave 3/Block 9.
* **Mindset for Perseverance**:
    * The program encourages athletes to **"keep going"** even when facing doubt, making the choice to persevere in each 60-second round. This consistent choice to "get back up for another round" is framed as a habit that will "bleed over into other areas of your life," implying that mental fortitude is a key aspect of progression.

# Auto-Regulation

The "45 MASTER SESSIONS Program" is explicitly designed with **self-regulation**, also known as **auto-regulation**, as a core principle, especially for "older athletes" or those with extensive lifting experience. This approach allows the program to be adaptable to individual needs, daily energy levels, and recovery capacity.

Here's a tutorial on how self-regulation is applied within this program:

### Understanding Self-Regulation in "45 MASTER SESSIONS"

Self-regulation in this program means that **you, the athlete, have a significant degree of control over the challenge level and intensity of each training session**. The program provides the structure, but you adjust the variables to match your current physical and mental state, ensuring optimal results and injury prevention.

### Key Methods of Self-Regulation:

1.  **Manipulating Bar Weight Based on Daily Readiness**:
    * During the **Volume Block**, which runs "Every Minute on the Minute" (EMOM) for 10 minutes, you are encouraged to **manipulate the bar weight throughout the 10 sets**.
    * The goal is to match your **energy and focus levels for that specific day**. If you feel strong, you might maintain a higher weight, but if you're feeling fatigued, you can lighten the load to ensure quality reps. This yields the "best results possible" by allowing you to train optimally on any given day.
    * For new exercises where you don't have established PRs, you can use a **"ramping" method** for the 10 one-minute sets. This involves gradually adding a small amount of weight with each set until your form can no longer be effectively held or your bar speed slows down unacceptably. Once an appropriate weight is found, you stick with it for the remaining sets or adjust if it no longer feels appropriate.

2.  **Adding "Extra Work" for Increased Challenge (When Too Easy)**:
    * If a session, particularly a **VOLUME minute, feels "a little bit too easy,"** instead of solely increasing the weight on the bar, you can **"add pain" by incorporating extra core or conditioning exercises**.
    * These additional exercises should be performed *after* your main prescribed mover is completed within the 60-second minute.
    * For example, if you're squatting for 3 reps and finish quickly, you could add 15 Hollow Rocks or 3 Burpees in the remaining rest time. This significantly **increases the workload and decreases your rest periods**, making the session "exponentially harder".
    * The crucial instruction here is to **"always combine the extra core or conditioning work AFTER the prescribed main mover"** to ensure you are as fresh as possible for the reps that "truly matter the most". The program emphasizes **never sacrificing form for speed or weight**.

3.  **Choosing Exercise Variations and Specialty Bars**:
    * The program frequently offers variations for main lifts (e.g., Deadlifts or 13” Deadlifts, Strict Presses or Push Presses, Squats or Front Squats, Bench Presses or Close Grip Bench Presses).
    * You are **"feel free to use a different Variation or Speciality Bar instead"**. This allows you to address common areas of weakness or simply make the program "more fun and interesting to run".

4.  **Adjusting Training Frequency Based on Recovery**:
    * While the program encourages "as close to 24-48 Hours between barbell sessions as possible" for maximum benefit, it explicitly acknowledges that the target population "is mainly going to struggle with recovery".
    * Therefore, you are encouraged to **"take as long as needed between workouts"**.
    * This self-regulation of frequency means some athletes might choose to stay "a little bit lighter with your choices and hitting the gym daily," while others might opt for heavier sessions and "stretch the 5 sessions out over a 10 day split".

5.  **Mental Self-Regulation and Perseverance**:
    * Beyond physical adjustments, the program highlights the **mental aspect of self-regulation**. There will be moments, particularly around sets 4-6 of the 10-minute Volume Blocks, where you feel like quitting.
    * The program instructs you to **"keep going,"** complete just "1 more set," and re-evaluate after "60 more seconds".
    * This repeated choice to "persevere" rather than "quit" every minute is framed as a **habit that will "bleed over into other areas of your life,"** reinforcing the idea that your choices in the gym build mental fortitude.

By continuously making these choices, you are engaging in self-regulation, ensuring that the "45 MASTER SESSIONS Program" remains effective, safe, and engaging for your long-term fitness journey. The emphasis on low reps and perfect form in each set further supports this self-regulatory approach, helping to ingrain good movement patterns and prevent injury over time.
